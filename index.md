### About Me

<img align="right" width="200" src="headshot3.JPG">

My name is Alexa Penwell and I am currently a student at UNC Chapel Hill working towards completing my Bachelor of Science in Statistics and Analytics with a minor in Information Systems. During my 3 years at UNC I have been taking courses focused around data analytics and information technologies. My intention is to purse a job utilizing a combination of these skillsets after graduation in December 2021. I have recently completed the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certification in order to increase my knowledge of cloud computing. Below I have put together a few projects I have completed to allow employers to get a better grasp on my technical abilities.

### Data Analytics

#### Project 1 : Human Freedom Index Analysis

**Class: STOR 320: Introduction to Data Science**

**Project Description:** At the start of this project, we were put in groups and tasked to find a dataset that contained enough quantitative and qualitative variables that we could use to complete different types of analysis that we had learned throughout this class. As a group we created a project proposal that was then taken to our professor for approval. Once the project was approved, we completed an Exploratory Data Analysis where we brainstormed hypothesis questions and did preliminary modeling to explore our chosen hypotheses. After finishing this step, our group broke up into individuals to complete our final paper. The final paper, which is the project you can see here, shows an outline of the whole project through 4 parts: Introduction, Data, Results, and Conclusion.

**Skills Used:** R, logistic regression, 10 fold cross-validation, confusion matrices


#### Project 2 : Staying Out of the Kitchen: An Analysis of Winners, Errors, and Other Factors that Lead to Success in Pickleball

**Class: STOR 538: Sports Analytics**

**Project Description:** This project was a group project that first required our team to pick a non-mainstream sport and think about what metrics we could analyze that would hopefully give a player a competitive edge. Based on what our proposed insights were, we then collected data by hand by watching YouTube videos of full matches. We then created graphs and tables to summarize our data. We used those graphs to manipulate the data in hopes of obtaining previously unexplored insights. Finally, we wrapped up the project by critiquing our data collection and analysis processes.

**Skills Used:** R, data collection, metric creation, proportion tests, linear regression

#### Project 3 : NBA 2021 April 13-30: Best Models to Predict Spread, Total, and Offensive Rebounds of Games

**Class: STOR 538: Sports Analytics**

**Project Description:** This project was a group project that required our team to use whichever models we thought were best to generate predictions for spread, total, and offensive rebounds for each NBA game in the given time frame. We were given data and had to clean and merge the datasets to fit our needs. We then conducted basic modeling for each of our three predictor variables to see what other variables might be good indicators of our given variable. After obtaining this information during the basic modeling stage, we conducted advanced modeling in hopes of finding a model that had the least amount of error possible. Error was measured here by a model's root mean squared error (RMSE). We conducted this process for all three variables until we were satisfied with the error levels. We then used our best model to generate predictions for our games. A more detailed account of our process, as well as our actual outcomes, can be viewed in the files below.


**Skills Used:** R, data cleaning, model comparison, linear regression, decision tree regressor, random forest regressor, support vector machine regressor

**Class: INLS 523: Database Systems I**

**Project Description:** This semester-long database project covered the whole process of database design and development, beginning with understanding requirements and turning them into a database design, and ending with running queries in our fully functioning database. I created ER diagrams, database schemas, data dictionaries, and SQL create statements and queries.

**Skills Used:** SQL, semantic data modeling, using relational models, data normalization, quality control
