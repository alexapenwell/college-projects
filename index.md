### About Me

<img align="left" width="100" height="100" src="headshot.png">

My name is Alexa Penwell and I am currently a student at UNC Chapel Hill working towards completing my Bachelor of Science in Statistics and Analytics with a minor in Information Systems. During my 3 years at UNC I have been taking courses focused around data analytics and information technologies with the intention of pursing a job in this skillset after graduation in December 2021. I have also completed the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certification in order to increase my knowledge of cloud computing. Currently I am looking to obtain an internship for Summer 2021 to further the application of the skills I have learned at UNC. Below I have put together a couple of the projects I have completed to allow employers to get a better grasp on my technical abilities.

### Data Analytics

#### Project 1 : Human Freedom Index Analysis

**Class: STOR 320: Introduction to Data Science**

**Project Description:** At the start of this project, we were put in groups and tasked to find a dataset that contained enough quantitative and qualitative variables that we could use to complete different types of analysis that we had learned throughout this class. As a group we created a project proposal that was then taken to our professor for approval. Once the project was approved, we completed an Exploratory Data Analysis where we brainstormed hypothesis questions and did preliminary modeling to explore our chosen hypotheses. After finishing this step, our group broke up into individuals to complete our final paper. The final paper, which is the project you can see here, shows an outline of the whole project through 4 parts: Introduction, Data, Results, and Conclusion.

**Skills Used:** R, logistic regression, 10 fold cross-validation, confusion matrices

### Information Science

**Class: INLS 523: Database Systems I**

**Project Description:** Ths semester-long database project covered the whole process of database design and development, beginning with understanding requirements and turning them into a database design, and ending with running queries in our fully functioning database. I created ER diagrams, database schemas, data dictionaries, and SQL create statements and queries.

**Skills Used:** SQL, semantic data modeling, using relational models, data normalization, quality control
