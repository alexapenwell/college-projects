## Welcome to My Project Repository!

Here I have compiled a few of the projects I have completed during my time at UNC to allow employers to get a better grasp on my technical abilities.

### Data Analytics Projects

#### Project 1 : Human Freedom Index Analysis
<a href="FP.html" title="Click here to view project">Data Analytics Final Project</a>

**Class: STOR 320: Introduction to Data Science**
**Project Description:** At the start of this project, we were put in groups and tasked to find a dataset that contained enough quantitative and qualitative variables that we could use to complete different types of analysis that we had learned throughout this class. As a group we created a project proposal that was then taken to our professor for approval. Once the project was approved, we completed an Exploratory Data Analysis where we brainstormed hypothesis questions and did preliminary modeling to explore our chosen hypotheses. After finishing this step, our group broke up into individuals to complete our final paper. The final paper, which is the project you can see here, shows an outline of the whole project through 4 parts: Introduction, Data, Results, and Conclusion.
**Skills Used:** R, logistic regression, 10 fold cross-validation, confusion matrices
